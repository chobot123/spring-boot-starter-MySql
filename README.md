# Spring Boot Starter with MySQL

## Overview

This Spring Boot starter project is set up to integrate with a MySQL database. Use this as a foundation for developing your applications that require MySQL database connectivity.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Maven
- MySQL Server installed locally or accessible remotely

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd spring-boot-starter-mysql
```

### Configure MySQL Connection

```bash
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://${MYSQL_HOST:localhost}:3306/db_example
spring.datasource.username=springuser
spring.datasource.password=ThePassword
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
#spring.jpa.show-sql: true
```
Replace your_database_name, your_username, and your_password with your MySQL database details.

### Build and Run Application

```bash
mvn clean install
java -jar target/spring-boot-starter-mysql-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

The application will start, and you can access it at **http://localhost:8080**.

### MySQL Configuration
Ensure that your MySQL server is running and accessible. If needed, modify the MySQL connection details in application.yml to match your MySQL server configuration.

### Additional Configuration
Feel free to extend this starter project based on your application requirements. Add controllers, services, and entities to build the functionality you need.
